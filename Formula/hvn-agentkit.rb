  # The install step only copies prebuilt files and writes two shell shims — nothing is
  # compiled. Without a bottle, Homebrew still treats installation as a build from source
  # and runs `fatal_build_from_source_checks`, which hard-fails on any macOS whose
  # `Xcode.minimum_version` outranks the installed Xcode (every prerelease macOS, where that
  # minimum is derived as "<macos>.0"). Shipping a bottle skips those checks entirely.
  # The bottle is platform-independent: `:any` because the shims embed a Cellar path that
  # Homebrew rewrites from its @@HOMEBREW_CELLAR@@ placeholder at pour time.

  # hak 2.0.0 raised its engine floor to Node >= 22. Homebrew's `node` formula is well past that,
  # so the bare dependency still resolves — but a user on an older pinned node will now fail at
  # runtime rather than install time.
